This software provides FBI personnel the means to validate, schedule and admit visitors to CJIS facilities. Retention of visitor, organization and related visit details provide management of facility access requests. Active Directory services leveraged during POC and Visitor lookup and auto population of form submission fields. Existing data was cleaned of duplicates and inaccuracies and guaranteed no lost visitor denials and other historically important information.\nSagent Partners LLC Quantico VA 8-11-2015 - 10-20-2015\nMember of team adding new functionality to and solving defects found in the \"FBI Virtual Academy\" enterprise \nonline learning system.\nJacobs Technology Inc. Tampa FL 10-2014 - 06-17-2015\nL-3 STRATIS Tampa FL 9-2008 - 10-2014 (same contract)\n Key software developer/analyst with top secret clearances \nwithin the Joint Mission Analysis (JMA) team at USSOCOM MacDill AFB. A three-fold processing speed increase was achieved for the legacy SCRAAM application after sole re-write / conversion using VB.Net with ODP.Net SCRAAM \n(SOF Capabilities-based Risk Assessment Allocation Model) performs \nresource allocation processing over thousands of time \nperiods while applying ad-hoc rules.\nSCRAAM re-write employed ODP.Net SQL bind variables, statement caching and novel use of global temp table for inner joins on a unique index during repetitive data accesses sped data processing. The legacy ad-hoc rules in VBScript were parsed into VB.Net and compiled at runtime into an assembly of fast callable methods which replaced a slower Windows Script Host implementation. \nSuccessfully completed an urgent task to finish the partially developed and broken \"Aviation Support application\".\nVastly improved simulation of actual aviation resource use and availability within Aviation Support. This enhancement displayed symbols within a new ESRI map viewer at map points for aviation resupply and infil mission support requests. The dynamic map display assisted the SME while assembling multiple sequential sorties within the Aviation Support application.\nCarbiz USA Inc. Sarasota FL 7-2007 - 5-2008\nAs lead VB.Net/VBA developer, designed and implemented a consolidated reporting solution that cloned legacy database objects, added id fields to table structures, parsed Crystal report definitions at runtime, and created dynamic SQL insert queries containing links to remote data. Database limitations were met by limiting data collection to tables, fields and ad hoc selection criteria into like-named schema referred to in the report. Report data locations were re-directed to the Db clones at runtime and grouping by lot id provided separation within the reports.\nDeveloped Windows Forms application that increased the \"customer base\" for the used car sales chain/consulting firm. This software converted dissimilar customer, inventory and sales data from rival lot management systems to Carbiz data stores. The threaded application cleansed data of duplicates, inconsistencies and incomplete records and wrote validated sales entries. Delimited output is logged during runtime and describes any invalid sales records and data cleaning exclusions for post conversion analysis. VB.Net, ADO.Net, Framework 2.0\nEnhanced existing application with .Net Web service that \nautomated upload of automobile loan applications.
