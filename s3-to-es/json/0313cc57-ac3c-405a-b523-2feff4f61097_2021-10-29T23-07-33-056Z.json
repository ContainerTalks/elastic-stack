Mitchell Groeneveld \nmitchgro@hotmail.com | 21181 E Hwy 28A, Chelsea, OK 74016 | 206-954-2065\nIntroduction\nI am an IT Professional with many years of experience in all sizes of environments up to and including Microsoft's own enterprise network. I've filled multiple roles from Technical Project Manager, Infrastructure Systems Analyst, Network Administration, Helpdesk Manager, Executive Support, Data Center Architect, Program Manager and Group Manager in Microsoft IT. I have travelled the globe providing guidance to other Microsoft enterprise customers regarding SCCM and AD implementations. I've worked directly with CIOs, IT Managers, Helpdesk Managers, and various Systems Administrators on multiple topics. I'm currently considering remote opportunities.\nRelated Work Experience\n7/2013 - 2/2020 | Sr. Technical Project Manager & Lead ISA | Daimler Trucks North America Contractor \nWindows 7 to Windows 10 Migration: \nProblem: Daimler Trucks North America had over 7000 systems running Windows 7 that are used to manufacture trucks, chassis, parts, and diesel engines. Each plant has unique machinery, both internally and externally developed applications, and systems designed for one task. Win7 was expiring and they wanted to reduce production line costs.\nResults: Originally, I was just consulting on the migration due to infrastructure project conflicts. After migration failures and personnel changes, I resumed my role for OS Migration with my concurrent infrastructure work. I instituted my migration decision tree to assess each system individually to determine one of three paths: Citrix thin client, Windows 10, or Windows 7 containment. I personally assessed each system, managed the Plant Floor application compatibility and desktop standardization programs. \nSecure Information Technology on Shop-floor: \nProblem: Daimler Trucks North America migrated enterprise systems but removed automation from the STN scope due to budget and lack of expertise. Their Cleveland truck plant went so far as to kick the STN team off the site after multiple incidents. A variety of technologies require a variety of migration techniques.\nResults: Having proved myself with STN elsewhere and Windows 7 migration, CTMP allowed me to come and complete STN. Subsequently, they asked specifically for me for their SITS implementation going so far as to pay half my annual rate to offset corporate project cost. I determined best methods for each technology, put plans in place, and migrated all automation related equipment to a new segmented infrastructure.\nSecure Truck Network: \nProblem: Daimler Trucks North America has networking gear and cabling at various locations that is up to 15 years old and the technology in use is considered obsolete and no longer secure.\nResults: I started as the ISA at the first location to cutover to new technology. The project was failing prior to my arrival but the revised team was able to successfully complete the project. As a result, I was retained to do more buildings and was quickly promoted to Lead ISA to help other local ISAs succeed in their cutovers as well. Over the course of the project, ISAs at several locations were fired. I completed deployments at all 9 corporate buildings, 4 of the 6 production plants in USA and consulted at the rest. I was the only ISA who completed an automation upgrade at DTNA.\nWindows XP to Windows 7 Migration: \nProblem: Daimler Trucks North America had 5000 systems running Windows XP that are used to manufacture trucks, chassis, and diesel engines. Each plant has unique machinery, both internally and externally developed applications, and systems designed for one task. XP was expiring and they wanted to reduce production line costs.\nResults: I developed a migration decision tree to assess each system individually to determine one of three paths; Citrix thin client, Windows 7, or Windows XP containment. I personally assessed each system and helped improve both their SCCM methods and processes to successfully deploy Windows 7 and PC Extender to convert PCs to Citrix Thin Clients.\n8/2012 - 6/2013 | Sr. Technical Project Manager | United States Dept. of Labor Contractor\nWindows XP to Windows 7 Migration: \nProblem: The DOL wanted to upgrade machine Operating Systems nationwide. Machine refresh and individual upgrades are too costly, required application compatibility testing of several departmental applications, and strategies to identify and mitigate risks.\nResults: After a 6-month project I had everything organized and prioritized the application compatibility testing, packaging, and new version release controls. This allowed a successful migration from Windows XP to Windows 7\n10/2007 - 12/2012 | Sr. Technical Project, PMO, & Support Manager | Schakra Inc. Employee at Microsoft\nHotmail to Outlook Live Customer Migration: \nProblem: The Microsoft Live@Edu Team supporting education space customers with cloud services needed to migrate over 1000 customers with over 20 Million accounts from the legacy Hotmail offering to their Exchange-based Outlook Live\nResults: Leveraging my previous experience with Outlook Live and Exchange knowledge, I reviewed and corrected major misconceptions to ease the pain of an eviction process, found a dozen errors with the tools and processes resulting in redesign and rerelease of the tool. I managed the revised development and release leveraging agile. I became the SME, meeting with customers, and securing scheduled commitments. These efforts resulted in turning a failing process customers were avoiding into one they are eager to join. Meanwhile, I provided audit mechanisms to ensure we could set customer expectations appropriately, track progress, and identify and resolve issues earlier to lessen customer impacts.\nBuilt Migration Team and Processes: \nProblem: The Microsoft Managed Services Team supporting BPOS-S high profile customers was struggling to meet customer expectations and failing to meet needs of Microsoft executives when issues were escalated.\nResults: This included Interviewing, hiring, and managing a team of 10 Exchange specialists to support BPOS white glove customers. I also provided individual contributions by changing reporting processes to meet stringent requirements of Microsoft executives. I provided audit mechanisms to ensure team deliverables were met and exceed the expectations of both Microsoft and BPOS customer executives while conforming to ITIL and MOF.\nPilot and Release New Exchange Features: \nProblem: Exchange would release features via Outlook Live service and helpdesk would be inundated with calls due to customers not understanding how to implement and missing required business needs.\nResults: After building the new feature pilot framework based upon Agile Scrum and running the program. Early adopters were able to validate new features and provide input to documentation and suggest changes to minimize confusion and tailor it to practical business needs. This also identified features that needed to be postponed, requiring more work when pilot customers were unable to implement. \nOutlook Live Service & Release Management: \nProblem: The Exchange product group at Microsoft recognized the need to leverage experienced release and service managers to work directly with customers and demonstrate the improved value of this service over Hotmail in the Education Space\nResults: I was brought into the service that had 28 customers and 40,000 mailboxes worldwide, plenty of product and feature information, but very little service tracking let alone ways to improve. Upon my departure, the service had over 18,000 customers with over 60 million mailboxes, a well-established service desk based on MOF, automated service data and Agile based processes, and replaced Hotmail as the Only offer for education. \n2/2004 - 10/2007 | SCCM Operations Group Manager | Microsoft Corporation Employee\nSCCM Worldwide Client Health Project: \nProblem: SMS Clients were present but unhealthy and security patch management was less than adequate.\nResults: Investigations proved that WMI corruption was the primary cause of SMS Client failures followed by users disabling the start-up script. Both start-up and login scripts were deployed to both install and repair the SMS client and send notification of WMI issues. This resulted in 250,000 desktops being managed with 98% security patch compliance being met monthly. \nSCCM and SMS 2003 SP2 Dogfood: \nProblem: Microsoft recognized the need to validate software early and often in the production environment prior to shipment.\nResults: All 250,000 desktops and 15,000 data center servers were being managed by pre-release versions of SCCM and SMS 2003 SP1 and SP2 successfully by Microsoft IT while we found over 700 product bugs with over 80 blocking bugs for all products combined. We started with 25,000 production systems running on the Beta 1 version of each product and scaled upward with each pre-release version.\nApplication & Image Deployment Strategy: \nProblem: Microsoft recognized the need to validate OS and other applications early and often in the production environment prior to shipment.\nResults: We wrote a simple step-by-step checklist available via web to walk Release PMs through the engagement process allowing us to streamline the process and double the number of application and OS deployments within a year achieving 95% of goal for every deployment.\nSOX Controls: \nProblem: Our first indemnification of key controls for SOX yielded 20 controls; some without measurement.\nResults: After transitioning to me, I reviewed these with close scrutiny side-by-side with SOX guidelines. I was able to reduce these to 7 measurable controls without doing anything \"extra\" just for SOX and down to 5 the following year. Both years we passed SOX external audits with no infractions.\nOutsourced Service Recovery: \nProblem: Our packaging and testing services were off shored to India to in house vendors. This was requiring many man hours of intervention prior to having useful packages for subsequent deployment.\nResults: I hired an FTE in India to manage the effort there; implementing SLA's and processes for rework turning this back into a successful service. This also enabled us to reduce the vendor headcount and was a major contributor to the successful rollout of Vista and Office 2007.\nSCCM Worldwide Client Reach Project: \nProblem: SMS 2003 was implemented but client saturation was only 90,000 of 245,000 desktops\nResults: After security concerns rejected the idea to use SMS built-in features to deploy clients, we decided to create a start-up script that would install the SMS client and 230,000 desktops were being managed after 1 year. \nSMS 2003 SP1 Dogfood: \nProblem: Microsoft recognized the need to validate software early and often in the production environment prior to shipment.\nResults: All 230,000 desktops were being managed by pre-release versions of SMS 2003 SP1 successfully by Microsoft IT while we found over 300 product bugs with over 50 blocking bugs.\nImage Deployment Strategy: \nProblem: RIS was already in place but many users were calling HelpDesk for installation and those who weren't would lose at least an hour of productivity.\nResults: We wrote a simple step-by-step guide available via web to walk users through RIS imaging virtually eliminating related HelpDesk calls. We implemented the new feature of OS Deployment making it possible to deploy images to large scale collections with no need for end user action saving thousands of man hours.\n2/2003 - 2/2004 | New Technologies Project Manager & Data Center Architect | Siemens Employee at UNIVAR\nGlobal Infrastructure Project: Cutting the Umbilical Cord - \nProblem: UNIVAR formed new corporate headquarters but were reliant on the USA Business Unit to provide their network computing needs.\nResults: With the design and implementation of a new corporate data center, UNIVAR is now \"back in charge\" of their USA Business Unit. VPN tunnels were established between headquarters and their primary business units: USA, Canada, Europe, Iberia, and South America. \nState of the Art Office: On the Cutting Edge; Without the Need to be Sharp - \nProblem: UNIVAR recognized the need of incorporating new technologies in the outset of their new office design.\nResults: Their new offices have both high speed and wireless infrastructure, are capable of video teleconferencing with global business units from any headquarters office, senior executives can present without a single manual connection change, key office staff can change lobby music without ever leaving their desks, and much more.\nIPAQ Initiative: Turning Toys into Tools - \nProblem: Three of UNIVAR's top level executives purchased IPAQ Pocket PCs and were using them solely as contact organizers and/or for playing games.\nResults: After some research and training 12 of 14 executives travel globally without laptops. They connect from anywhere globally, read and respond to e-mail, get spoken driving directions, take photographs, can give presentations, and much more.\n1/2000 - 2/2003 | PROJECT MANAGER/EXECUTIVE & DATA CENTER SUPPORT | Siemens Employee at Microsoft\nMicrosoft's Executive Showcase Data Center Project:\nProblem: Vendors wanted their latest and greatest equipment on display in Microsoft's Executive Briefing Center.\nResults: To bargain for window space, vendors donated equipment regularly. We researched other needs within the briefing center and received free equipment to meet those needs as well.\nAccommodating Microsoft's Dogfood Philosophy:\nProblem: Microsoft wanted to demonstrate the use and reliability of their software to their highest-level customers while still in Beta.\nResults: We implemented a dual system configuration such that a presenter could switch to the secondary beta-free system with the touch of a single button\n5/1997 - 1/2000 | PROJECT MANAGER & RESEARCH ASSOCIATE | JX Crystals, Inc. Employee\nFlatPack: Measurement device for the Thermo-Photo-Voltaic (TPV) Industry - \nProblem: JX Crystals recognized the need for measuring many small samples and analyzing data. \nResults: Designed and implemented a water-cooled electric device for use at high temperatures that could accommodate single TPV cells, selective emitters, and optical filters. This was designed around their current optics bench and associated data collection equipment. This device was successful enough to become a marketable product, achieve publication and presentation for the National Renewable Energies Lab in Denver, CO.\nVacuum FlatPack: Redesign of the FlatPack to test selective emitters in a vacuum -\nProblem: Innovations in the TPV Industry required materials testing within a high temperature vacuum.\nResults: A modification to the previous version allowed simply replacing one portion of the FlatPack and still use all the previous optics bench and data collection equipment. \nVarious classified projects funded by the U.
